## §1 — Attestation

As of 2026-06-23, the durable geocode audit substrate is live in production. Migration 011 has been applied to the production Supabase, creating `public.geocode_dispositions` with the app-INSERT-only RLS wall (Fork H-a) and adding `freeze_audit_orphaned` to `public.section8_runs`. The route-handler synchronous disposition write (G-b) is deployed in `app/api/notice/geocode/route.ts` with its 250ms hard timeout and swallow-on-fail behavior; the deferred audit-row write in `after()` remains in place per the preserved Slice 4c §2.8 audit-write-off-user-response principle. The §8 reconciliation monitor (`scripts/section8_monitor.ts`) is armed via the launchd agent, and its first attested run against production has returned green — durable-vs-durable, monitor-not-degraded, both orphan quantities at zero.

The `geocodeAuditDurabilityWired` predicate asserts exactly one thing: that geocode dispositions and their corresponding audit rows are durably recorded in two independent database tables, reconciled by the §8 monitor on its scheduled cadence, and therefore not dependent on Vercel's ephemeral log retention for compliance-grade auditability. That condition is now met. The architectural work the predicate was waiting on (Slice 8 deliverable 4b, including Forks D / E / F-a / G-b / H-a and the corrected §8 N1 monitor logic) is merged on `main`. The production-code attribution audit (P-4 of the 2026-06-23 broker response) is complete and verified per `ownerpilot_attribution_compliance_audit_report_2026-06-23.md` — zero `Janna` or `269639` tokens in production code, the LA jurisdiction-rules framing corrections from §3 of `la_jurisdiction_attorney_framing_broker_ruling_response_2026-06-23.md` landed in PR #66, and the D-2 "separate attorney path" framing from the original 2026-06-22 attestation request is closed on the record. With those preconditions cleared, the substrate is independently verifiable, the monitor is detecting at production cadence, and the predicate accurately describes the deployed reality.

As broker and sole compliance authority for OwnerPilot AI under CalDRE B9445457, I authorize flipping `geocodeAuditDurabilityWired` from `false` to `true` in `lib/jurisdiction/laRtcRules.ts` as a single-line, one-character, exact-match-or-abort patch per the §1.1 per-flag-flip amendment discipline. This authorization is scoped to this one predicate. It does not open LA production — three other predicates in `LA_PRODUCTION_DEPENDENCIES` (`rtcFormRefreshJobBuilt`, `cityOfLaZipsAuthoritative`, `parcelEndpointHealthCheckLive`) remain `false`, `isLaProductionUnblocked()` continues to return `false`, the master gate stays closed, and no LA notices may be served until each of those three predicates passes its own independent attestation cycle. Each will be attested separately, on its own evidence, and templated off the corrected D-2 broker-scope-only framing in `geocode_audit_durability_gate_flip_broker_response_2026-06-23.md` §2.4 — not off any pre-pivot artifact's framing.
