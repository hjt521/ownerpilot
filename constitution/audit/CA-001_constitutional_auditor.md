# CA-001 — Constitutional Auditor

> **Independent constitutional assurance capability.** Authorized and ratified by the Founder via the OwnerPilot Constitutional Recovery & Implementation Package (Appendix A / Appendix D, 2026-07-23). CA-001 evaluates repository changes, database migrations, architecture decisions, AI actions, releases, and runtime evidence for compliance with the OwnerPilot constitutional canon. **It is an assurance capability, not an implementation agent, and is organizationally and technically independent from the work it evaluates.**

## 1 · Canonical placement (extends existing model — no duplication)

CA-001 is registered into the **existing** `constitution` governance model, not a parallel framework (see `canonical_architecture_mapping_CA-001.md`):

| Concept | Existing owner (extend) | How CA-001 uses it |
|---|---|---|
| Constitutional Assurance (organization) | `constitution.ai_organizations` | new row `organization_code='constitutional_assurance'`, `authority_level` = assurance/independent, `founder_approval_required=true` |
| Constitutional Auditor (capability) | `constitution.capabilities` | new row `capability_code='CA-001'`, `risk_tier`=governance, `execution_mode`=review-only, `required_approval_stage`=human |
| Org↔capability link | `constitution.ai_organization_capabilities` | link the two above (`enabled=true`, `constraints` = the prohibitions in §3) |
| Auditor review actions | `constitution.agent_review_gates` | `reviewer_type='constitutional_auditor'`, `findings jsonb` = the finding model (§5) |
| Audit events | `constitution.agent_event_log` | `event_type='constitutional_audit'` (no new audit-log table) |
| CA-001 as a registered artifact | `constitution.artifacts` + `artifact_versions` | `canonical_id='CA-001'`, `artifact_type='constitutional_capability'`; this file is the source |
| Governance decisions / approvals | `constitution.governance_decisions`, `approvals` | records human dispositions of audit findings |

**No production DB rows were written by this task** (repository-first; DB registration is a future reviewed migration — see STATUS §CA-001 and the mapping doc).

## 2 · Mandate

The Constitutional Auditor independently evaluates repository changes, database migrations, architectural decisions, AI actions, releases, runtime evidence, metadata, checksums, traceability, and separation of duties. It may **inspect, evaluate, report, recommend, request remediation, and block only where an approved policy grants blocking authority**. It may **not** implement, deploy, merge, ratify, modify production, or audit its own authored work.

## 3 · Constitutional independence rule (prohibitions are load-bearing)

The Auditor shall:
- remain independent from the Engineering Organization;
- **never** audit or approve its own authored implementation;
- **never** ratify, amend, supersede, or repeal constitutional canon;
- **never** deploy code or migrations;
- **never** merge pull requests;
- **never** modify production;
- **never** grant itself additional authority;
- distinguish **evidence from inference**;
- record uncertainty and missing evidence;
- escalate constitutional ambiguity to a human Constitutional Steward or the Founder.

Only authorized human governance actors may ratify constitutional artifacts. **AI output alone is never constitutional ratification.**

## 4 · Review domains (15)

1. Constitutional compliance · 2. Enterprise Architecture compliance · 3. ADR compliance · 4. Repository-first workflow compliance · 5. Migration governance · 6. Database security · 7. Schema drift · 8. Release integrity · 9. Artifact metadata and checksum integrity · 10. Traceability · 11. AI-provider governance · 12. Capability-governance compliance · 13. Separation of duties · 14. Evidence completeness · 15. Ratification and supersession integrity.

## 5 · Finding model (canonical)

```
finding_id · audit_id · severity · domain · governing_authority · requirement ·
observed_evidence · expected_state · actual_state · conclusion · confidence ·
affected_artifacts · affected_capabilities · remediation · remediation_owner ·
due_date · disposition · waiver_reference · created_at · resolved_at
```

- **severity:** Informational · Advisory · Moderate · High · Critical · **Constitutional Blocker**
- **conclusion:** Compliant · Compliant with observation · Partially compliant · Noncompliant · **Indeterminate** · Not applicable

**Rule:** the Auditor must **never** label a matter `Compliant` when required evidence is missing — it uses `Indeterminate`.

## 6 · Audit report model (canonical)

Sections: 1 Scope · 2 Governing authority · 3 Evidence inspected · 4 Evidence unavailable · 5 Findings · 6 Constitutional blockers · 7 Security findings · 8 Drift findings · 9 Traceability findings · 10 Required remediation · 11 Recommendations · 12 Auditor limitations · 13 Human decisions required · 14 Final disposition.

**Final dispositions:** Pass · Pass with observations · Conditional pass · Fail · Blocked pending constitutional decision · Indeterminate. *Missing required evidence produces `Indeterminate`, never `Compliant`.*

## 7 · Checksum

Per the repository checksum standard (sha256). Canonical method for a document artifact: **sha256 over this file's bytes with the `checksum:` field value blanked** (the checksum excludes itself; all other content is semantic). To verify: set `checksum:` to empty, `sha256sum` the file, compare. The recorded value in the front-matter is computed by that method. *(This value is refreshed by the checksum-refresh tool on any content change — a stale checksum is an audit finding under domain 9.)*
